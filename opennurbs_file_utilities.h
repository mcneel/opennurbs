  Description:
    Find the locations in a path the specify the drive, directory,

  Parameters:
    path - [in]
      path to split
    volume - [out] (pass null if you don't need the volume)
      If volume is not null and the path parameter begins with a
      Windows volume specification, *volume will either be
      the Windows volume letter followed by the trailing colon
      or a Windows UNC \\<hostname>.  Otherwise volume will
      be the empty string.
    dir - [out] (pass null if you don't need the directory)
      If dir is not null and the path parameter contains a
      directory specification, then the returned value of *dir
      will be the directory specification including the trailing
      slash.
    file_name_stem - [out] (pass null if you don't need the file name stem)
      If file_name_stem is not null and the path parameter contains a
      file name specification, then the returned value of *file_name_stem
      will be the file name stem.
    file_name_ext - [out] (pass null if you don't need the extension)
      If file_name_ext is not null and the path parameter contains a
      file name extension specification, then the returned value of
      *file_name_ext will be the file name extension including the initial
      '.' character.
  Remarks:
    This function will treat a front slash ( / ) and a back slash
    ( \ ) as directory separators.  Because this function parses
    file names store in .3dm files and the .3dm file may have been
    written on a Windows computer and then read on a another
    computer, it looks for a volume specification even when the
    operating system is not Windows.
    This function will not return an directory that does not
    end with a trailing slash.
    This function will not return an empty filename and a non-empty
    extension.
    This function parses the path string according to these rules.
    It does not check the actual file system to see if the answer
    is correct.

  /*
  Description:
    Initialize where the search should occur.
  Parameters:
    directory_name - [in]
      The directory to look in.
    item_name_filter - [in]
      If this parameter is null, then the iteration
      includes all names in the directory.
      The item name to search for. This parameter can 
      include wildcard characters, such as an
      asterisk (*) or a question mark (?). For example,

  Returns:

    Calling FirstItem() is equivalent to calling Initialize() and then calling NextItem().
