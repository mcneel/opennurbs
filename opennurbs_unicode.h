       the value of the overlong sUTF-8 equence was a valid
       unicode code point. 
          
       This error is masked if 0 != (8 & m_error_mask).
       If the error is masked, then the unicode code point

   16: An illegal UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 sequence occurred, 
      or an unsupported or invalid Windows code page value,      
      or an invalid unicode code point value resulted from 
      decoding a UTF-8 sequence.

       If the error is masked and the value of m_error_code_point is
       a valid unicode code point, then m_error_code_point is used

  NOTE WELL: 
  The Windows code page 949 encoding uses both single and double byte encodings.
  When the initial byte has a value < 0x80, it is a single byte encoding.
  When the initial byte has a value > 0x80, it is a double byte encoding.

Description:
  Convert a unicode string from a UTF-8 encoded char array
  into a UTF-8 encoded char array.  This function can be
  used to clean UTF-8 strings that have a leading
  byte-order-mark (BOM) or contain encoding errors.

Parameters:
  bTestByteOrder - [in]
    If bTestByteOrder is true and the the input buffer is a 
    byte order mark (BOM), then the BOM is skipped.  It the value
    of the BOM is byte swapped, then subsequent input elements are
    byte swapped before being decoded. Specifically:
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 1 byte and the
      values of the first three input elements are a UTF-8 BOM 
      (0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF), then the first three input elements are
      ignored and decoding begins at the forth input element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-16 BOM (0xFEFF), then the first
      element is ignored and decoding begins with the second element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a byte swapped UTF-16 BOM (0xFFFE), 
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-32 BOM (0x0000FEFF), then the 
      first element is ignored and decoding begins with the second
      element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is bytes swapped UTF-32 BOM (0xFFFE0000),
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the 
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - In all other cases the first element of the input buffer is
      decoded and no byte swapping is performed.

  sInputUTF8 - [in]
    UTF-8 encoded string to convert.

  sInputUTF8_count - [in]
    If sInputUTF8_count >= 0, then it specifies the number of
    char elements in sInputUTF8[] to convert.

    If sInputUTF8_count == -1, then sInputUTF8 must be a null
    terminated string and all the elements up to the first 
    null element are converted.

  sOutputUTF8 - [out]
    If sOutputUTF8 is not null and sOutputUTF8_count > 0, then 
    the output UTF-8 encoded string is returned in this buffer. 
    If there is room for the null terminator, the converted string
    will be null terminated. The null terminator is never included
    in the count returned by this function. No byte order mark is
    prepended.

  sOutputUTF8_count - [in]
    If sOutputUTF8_count > 0, then it specifies the number of available
    char elements in the sOutputUTF8[] buffer.
    
    If sOutputUTF8_count == 0, then the sOutputUTF8 parameter is ignored.

  error_status - [out]
    If error_status is not null, then bits of *error_status are
    set to indicate the success or failure of the conversion.  
    When the error_mask parameter is used to used to mask some
    conversion errors, multiple bits may be set.
       0: Successful conversion with no errors.
       1: The input parameters were invalid. 
          This error cannot be masked.
       2: The output buffer was not large enough to hold the converted
          string. As much conversion as possible is performed in this
          case and the error cannot be masked.
       4: When parsing a UTF-8 or UTF-32 string, the values of two
          consecutive encoding sequences formed a valid UTF-16 
          surrogate pair.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (4 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the surrogate pair is
          decoded, the value of the resulting unicode code point
          is used, and parsing continues.
       8: An overlong UTF-8 encoding sequence was encountered and 
          the value of the overlong sUTF-8 equence was a valid
          unicode code point.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (8 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the unicode code point
          is used and parsing continues.
      16: An illegal UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoding sequence occurred
          or an invalid unicode code point value resulted from decoding
          a UTF-8 sequence. 
          This error is masked if 0 != (16 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked and the value of error_code_point is
          a valid unicode code point, then error_code_point is encoded
          in the output string and parsing continues.

  error_mask - [in]
    If 0 != (error_mask & 4), then type 4 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 8), then type 8 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 16) and error_code_point is a valid unicode
    code point value, then type 16 errors are masked.

  error_code_point - [in]
    Unicode code point value to use in when masking type 16 errors.
    If 0 == (error_mask & 16), then this parameter is ignored.
    ON_UnicodeCodePoint::ON_ReplacementCharacter (U+FFFD) 
    is a popular choice for the error_code_point value.

  sNextInputUTF8 - [out]
    If sNextInputUTF8 is not null, then *sNextInputUTF8 points to
    the first element in the input sInputUTF8[] buffer that was not 
    converted. 

    If an error occurs and is not masked, then *sNextInputUTF8 points
    to the element of sInputUTF8[] where the conversion failed.
    If no errors occur or all errors are masked, then 
    *sNextInputUTF8 points to sInputUTF8 + sInputUTF8_count.

Returns:
  If sOutputUTF8_count > 0, the return value is the number of char
  elements written to sOutputUTF8[].  When the return value < sOutputUTF8_count,
  a null terminator is written to sOutputUTF8[return value].

  If sOutputUTF8_count == 0, the return value is the minimum number of
  char elements that are needed to hold the converted string.
  The return value does not include room for a null terminator.  
  Increment the return value by one if you want to have an element
  to use for a null terminator.

    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-16 BOM (0xFEFF), then the first
      element is ignored and decoding begins with the second element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a byte swapped UTF-16 BOM (0xFFFE), 
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-32 BOM (0x0000FEFF), then the

    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value

      being decoded.
    - In all other cases the first element of the input buffer is
      decoded and no byte swapping is performed.

  sUTF16 - [in]
    UTF-16 string to convert.  
    
    If bTestByteOrder is true and the first element of sUTF16[]
    is 0xFEFF, then this element is skipped and it is assumed 
    that sUTF16[] is in the CPU's native byte order.
    
    If bTestByteOrder is true and the first element of sUTF16[]
    is 0xFFFE, then this element is skipped and it is assumed 
    that sUTF16[] is not in the CPU's native byte order and bytes
    are swapped before characters are converted.

    If bTestByteOrder is false or the first character of sUTF16[]
    is neither 0xFEFF nor 0xFFFE, then the sUTF16 string must match
    the CPU's byte order.

  sUTF16_count - [in]
    If sUTF16_count >= 0, then it specifies the number of
    ON__UINT16 elements in sUTF16[] to convert.

    If sUTF16_count == -1, then sUTF16 must be a null terminated
    string and all the elements up to the first null element are
    converted.
    
  sUTF8 - [out]
    If sUTF8 is not null and sUTF8_count > 0, then the UTF-8
    encoded string is returned in this buffer. If there is room
    for the null terminator, the converted string will be null
    terminated. The null terminator is never included in the count 
    of returned by this function. The converted string is in the 
    CPU's native byte order. No byte order mark is prepended.

  sUTF8_count - [in]
    If sUTF8_count > 0, then it specifies the number of available
    char elements in the sUTF8[] buffer.
    
    If sUTF8_count == 0, then the sUTF8 parameter is ignored.

  error_status - [out]
    If error_status is not null, then bits of *error_status are
    set to indicate the success or failure of the conversion.  
    When the error_mask parameter is used to used to mask some
    conversion errors, multiple bits may be set.
       0: Successful conversion with no errors.
       1: The input parameters were invalid. 
          This error cannot be masked.
       2: The output buffer was not large enough to hold the converted
          string. As much conversion as possible is performed in this
          case and the error cannot be masked.
       4: When parsing a UTF-8 or UTF-32 string, the values of two
          consecutive encoding sequences formed a valid UTF-16 
          surrogate pair.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (4 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the surrogate pair is
          decoded, the value of the resulting unicode code point
          is used, and parsing continues.
       8: An overlong UTF-8 encoding sequence was encountered and 
          the value of the overlong sUTF-8 equence was a valid
          unicode code point.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (8 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the unicode code point
          is used and parsing continues.
      16: An illegal UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoding sequence occurred
          or an invalid unicode code point value resulted from decoding
          a UTF-8 sequence. 
          This error is masked if 0 != (16 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked and the value of error_code_point is
          a valid unicode code point, then error_code_point is encoded
          in the output string and parsing continues.

  error_mask - [in]
    If 0 != (error_mask & 4), then type 4 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 8), then type 8 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 16) and error_code_point is a valid unicode
    code point value, then type 16 errors are masked.

  error_code_point - [in]
    Unicode code point value to use in when masking type 16 errors.
    If 0 == (error_mask & 16), then this parameter is ignored.
    ON_UnicodeCodePoint::ON_ReplacementCharacter (U+FFFD) 
    is a popular choice for the error_code_point value.

  sNextUTF16 - [out]
    If sNextUTF16 is not null, then *sNextUTF16 points to the first
    element in the input sUTF16[] buffer that was not converted. 

    If an error occurs and is not masked, then *sNextUTF16 points to
    the element of sUTF16[] where the conversion failed.  If no errors
    occur or all errors are masked, then *sNextUTF16 points to
    sUTF16 + sUTF16_count.

Returns:
  If sUTF8_count > 0, the return value is the number of char
  elements written to sUTF8[].  When the return value < sUTF8_count,
  a null terminator is written to sUTF8[return value].

  If sUTF8_count == 0, the return value is the minimum number of
  char elements that are needed to hold the converted string.
  The return value does not include room for a null terminator.  
  Increment the return value by one if you want to have an element
  to use for a null terminator.

    If sOutputUTF16 is not null and sOutputUTF16_count > 0, then 
    the output UTF-16 encoded string is returned in this buffer. 
    If there is room for the null terminator, the converted string

    If sNextInputUTF16 is not null, then *sNextInputUTF16 points to
    the first element in the input sInputUTF16[] buffer that was not

    If sUTF8_count == 0, then the sUTF8 parameter is ignored.

  error_status - [out]
    If error_status is not null, then bits of *error_status are
    set to indicate the success or failure of the conversion.  
    When the error_mask parameter is used to used to mask some
    conversion errors, multiple bits may be set.
       0: Successful conversion with no errors.
       1: The input parameters were invalid. 
          This error cannot be masked.
       2: The output buffer was not large enough to hold the converted
          string. As much conversion as possible is performed in this
          case and the error cannot be masked.
       4: When parsing a UTF-8 or UTF-32 string, the values of two
          consecutive encoding sequences formed a valid UTF-16 
          surrogate pair.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (4 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the surrogate pair is
          decoded, the value of the resulting unicode code point
          is used, and parsing continues.
       8: An overlong UTF-8 encoding sequence was encountered and 
          the value of the overlong sUTF-8 equence was a valid
          unicode code point.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (8 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the unicode code point
          is used and parsing continues.
      16: An illegal UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoding sequence occurred
          or an invalid unicode code point value resulted from decoding
          a UTF-8 sequence. 
          This error is masked if 0 != (16 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked and the value of error_code_point is
          a valid unicode code point, then error_code_point is encoded
          in the output string and parsing continues.

  error_mask - [in]
    If 0 != (error_mask & 4), then type 4 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 8), then type 8 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 16) and error_code_point is a valid unicode
    code point value, then type 16 errors are masked.

  error_code_point - [in]
    Unicode code point value to use in when masking type 16 errors.
    If 0 == (error_mask & 16), then this parameter is ignored.
    ON_UnicodeCodePoint::ON_ReplacementCharacter (U+FFFD) 
    is a popular choice for the error_code_point value.

  sNextUTF32 - [out]
    If sNextUTF32 is not null, then *sNextUTF32 points to the first
    element in the input sUTF32[] buffer that was not converted. 

    If an error occurs and is not masked, then *sNextUTF32 points to
    the element of sUTF32[] where the conversion failed.  If no errors
    occur or all errors are masked, then *sNextUTF32 points to
    sUTF32 + sUTF32_count.

Returns:
  If sUTF8_count > 0, the return value is the number of char
  elements written to sUTF8[].  When the return value < sUTF8_count,
  a null terminator is written to sUTF8[return value].

  If sUTF8_count == 0, the return value is the minimum number of
  char elements that are needed to hold the converted string.
  The return value does not include room for a null terminator.  
  Increment the return value by one if you want to have an element
  to use for a null terminator.

Description:
  Convert a unicode string from a UTF-32 encoded ON__UINT32 array
  into a UTF-16 encoded ON__UINT16 array.

Parameters:
  bTestByteOrder - [in]
    If bTestByteOrder is true and the the input buffer is a 
    byte order mark (BOM), then the BOM is skipped.  It the value
    of the BOM is byte swapped, then subsequent input elements are
    byte swapped before being decoded. Specifically:
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 1 byte and the
      values of the first three input elements are a UTF-8 BOM 
      (0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF), then the first three input elements are
      ignored and decoding begins at the forth input element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-16 BOM (0xFEFF), then the first
      element is ignored and decoding begins with the second element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a byte swapped UTF-16 BOM (0xFFFE), 
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-32 BOM (0x0000FEFF), then the 
      first element is ignored and decoding begins with the second
      element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is bytes swapped UTF-32 BOM (0xFFFE0000),
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the 
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - In all other cases the first element of the input buffer is
      decoded and no byte swapping is performed.

  sUTF32 - [in]
    UTF-32 string to convert.  
    
    If bTestByteOrder is true and the first element of sUTF32[]
    is 0x0000FEFF, then this element is skipped and it is assumed 
    that sUTF32[] is in the CPU's native byte order.
    
    If bTestByteOrder is true and the first element of sUTF32[]
    is 0xFFFE0000, then this element is skipped and it is assumed 
    that sUTF32[] is not in the CPU's native byte order and bytes
    are swapped before characters are converted.

    If bTestByteOrder is false or the first character of sUTF32[]
    is neither 0x0000FEFF nor 0xFFFE0000, then the sUTF32 string 
    must match the CPU's byte order.

  sUTF32_count - [in]
    If sUTF32_count >= 0, then it specifies the number of
    ON__UINT32 elements in sUTF32[] to convert.

    If sUTF32_count == -1, then sUTF32 must be a null terminated
    string and all the elements up to the first null element are
    converted.

  sUTF16 - [out]
    If sUTF16 is not null and sUTF16_count > 0, then the UTF-16
    encoded string is returned in this buffer. If there is room
    for the null terminator, the converted string will be null
    terminated. The null terminator is never included in the count 
    of returned by this function. The converted string is in the 
    CPU's native byte order. No byte order mark is prepended.

  sUTF16_count - [in]
    If sUTF16_count > 0, then it specifies the number of available
    ON__UINT16 elements in the sUTF16[] buffer.
    
    If sUTF16_count == 0, then the sUTF16 parameter is ignored.

          decoded, the value of the resulting unicode code point
          is used, and parsing continues.
       8: An overlong UTF-8 encoding sequence was encountered and 
          the value of the overlong sUTF-8 equence was a valid
          unicode code point.

      16: An illegal UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoding sequence occurred
          or an invalid unicode code point value resulted from decoding
          a UTF-8 sequence. 
          This error is masked if 0 != (16 & m_error_mask).

          in the output string and parsing continues.

  error_mask - [in]
    If 0 != (error_mask & 4), then type 4 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 8), then type 8 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 16) and error_code_point is a valid unicode
    code point value, then type 16 errors are masked.

  error_code_point - [in]
    Unicode code point value to use in when masking type 16 errors.
    If 0 == (error_mask & 16), then this parameter is ignored.
    ON_UnicodeCodePoint::ON_ReplacementCharacter (U+FFFD) 
    is a popular choice for the error_code_point value.

  sNextUnicode - [out]
    If sNextUnicode is not null, then *sNextUnicode points to the first
    byte in the input sNextUnicode[] buffer that was not converted. 

    If an error occurs and is not masked, then this unsigned int
    will be an illegal unicode code point value.

    If an error does not occur, then (*sNextUnicode - sUnicode) 
    is the number of values converted.

Returns:

  sWideChar - [in]
    wchar_t input string to convert.  
    
  sWideChar_count - [in]

  sUTF8 - [out]
    If sUTF8 is not null and sUTF8_count > 0, then the UTF-8
    encoded string is returned in this buffer. If there is room
    for the null terminator, the converted string will be null

    If sUTF8_count == 0, then the sUTF8 parameter is ignored.

  error_status - [out]
    If error_status is not null, then bits of *error_status are
    set to indicate the success or failure of the conversion.  
    When the error_mask parameter is used to used to mask some
    conversion errors, multiple bits may be set.
       0: Successful conversion with no errors.
       1: The input parameters were invalid. 
          This error cannot be masked.
       2: The output buffer was not large enough to hold the converted
          string. As much conversion as possible is performed in this
          case and the error cannot be masked.
       4: When parsing a UTF-8 or UTF-32 string, the values of two
          consecutive encoding sequences formed a valid UTF-16 
          surrogate pair.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (4 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the surrogate pair is
          decoded, the value of the resulting unicode code point

       8: An overlong UTF-8 encoding sequence was encountered and 
          the value of the overlong sUTF-8 equence was a valid
          unicode code point.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (8 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the unicode code point

          or an invalid unicode code point value resulted from decoding
          a UTF-8 sequence. 
          This error is masked if 0 != (16 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked and the value of error_code_point is
          a valid unicode code point, then error_code_point is encoded

  error_mask - [in]
    If 0 != (error_mask & 4), then type 4 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 8), then type 8 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 16) and error_code_point is a valid unicode
    code point value, then type 16 errors are masked.

  error_code_point - [in]
    Unicode code point value to use in when masking type 16 errors.
    If 0 == (error_mask & 16), then this parameter is ignored.
    ON_UnicodeCodePoint::ON_ReplacementCharacter (U+FFFD) 
    is a popular choice for the error_code_point value.

  sNextWideChar - [out]
    If sNextWideChar is not null, then *sNextWideChar points to the first
    element in the input sWideChar[] buffer that was not converted. 

    If an error occurs and is not masked, then *sNextWideChar points to
    the element of sWideChar[] where the conversion failed.  If no errors
    occur or all errors are masked, then *sNextWideChar points to
    sWideChar + sWideChar_count.

  If sUTF8_count > 0, the return value is the number of char
  elements written to sUTF8[].  When the return value < sUTF8_count,
  a null terminator is written to sUTF8[return value].

  If sUTF8_count == 0, the return value is the minimum number of
  char elements that are needed to hold the converted string.
  The return value does not include room for a null terminator.  
  Increment the return value by one if you want to have an element
  to use for a null terminator.

Description:
  Convert a wchar_t string using the native platform's most common
  encoding into a unicode string encoded as a UTF-16 ON__UINT16 array.

  If 1 = sizeof(wchar_t), then the wchar_t array is assumed to be
  a UTF-8 encoded string.

  If 2 = sizeof(wchar_t), then the wchar_t array is assumed to be
  a UTF-16 encoded string. This is the case with current versions

  If 4 = sizeof(wchar_t), then the wchar_t array is assumed to be
  a UTF-32 encoded string. This is the case with current versions
  of Apple OS X.

Parameters:
  bTestByteOrder - [in]
    If bTestByteOrder is true and the the input buffer is a 
    byte order mark (BOM), then the BOM is skipped.  It the value
    of the BOM is byte swapped, then subsequent input elements are
    byte swapped before being decoded. Specifically:
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 1 byte and the
      values of the first three input elements are a UTF-8 BOM 
      (0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF), then the first three input elements are
      ignored and decoding begins at the forth input element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-16 BOM (0xFEFF), then the first
      element is ignored and decoding begins with the second element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a byte swapped UTF-16 BOM (0xFFFE), 
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-32 BOM (0x0000FEFF), then the 
      first element is ignored and decoding begins with the second
      element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is bytes swapped UTF-32 BOM (0xFFFE0000),
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the 
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - In all other cases the first element of the input buffer is
      decoded and no byte swapping is performed.

  sWideChar - [in]
    wchar_t input string to convert.  
    
  sWideChar_count - [in]
    If sWideChar_count >= 0, then it specifies the number of
    wchar_t elements in sWideChar[] to convert.

    If sWideChar_count == -1, then sWideChar must be a null terminated
    array and all the elements up to the first null element are
    converted.
    
  sUTF16 - [out]
    If sUTF16 is not null and sUTF16_count > 0, then the UTF-16
    encoded string is returned in this buffer. If there is room
    for the null terminator, the converted string will be null
    terminated. The null terminator is never included in the count 
    of returned by this function. The converted string is in the 
    CPU's native byte order. No byte order mark is prepended.

  sUTF16_count - [in]
    If sUTF16_count > 0, then it specifies the number of available
    ON__UINT16 elements in the sUTF16[] buffer.
    
    If sUTF16_count == 0, then the sUTF16 parameter is ignored.

  error_status - [out]
    If error_status is not null, then bits of *error_status are
    set to indicate the success or failure of the conversion.  
    When the error_mask parameter is used to used to mask some
    conversion errors, multiple bits may be set.
       0: Successful conversion with no errors.
       1: The input parameters were invalid. 
          This error cannot be masked.
       2: The output buffer was not large enough to hold the converted
          string. As much conversion as possible is performed in this
          case and the error cannot be masked.
       4: When parsing a UTF-8 or UTF-32 string, the values of two
          consecutive encoding sequences formed a valid UTF-16 
          surrogate pair.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (4 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the surrogate pair is
          decoded, the value of the resulting unicode code point
          is used, and parsing continues.
       8: An overlong UTF-8 encoding sequence was encountered and 
          the value of the overlong sUTF-8 equence was a valid
          unicode code point.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (8 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the unicode code point
          is used and parsing continues.
      16: An illegal UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoding sequence occurred
          or an invalid unicode code point value resulted from decoding
          a UTF-8 sequence. 
          This error is masked if 0 != (16 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked and the value of error_code_point is
          a valid unicode code point, then error_code_point is encoded
          in the output string and parsing continues.

  error_mask - [in]
    If 0 != (error_mask & 4), then type 4 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 8), then type 8 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 16) and error_code_point is a valid unicode
    code point value, then type 16 errors are masked.

  error_code_point - [in]
    Unicode code point value to use in when masking type 16 errors.
    If 0 == (error_mask & 16), then this parameter is ignored.
    ON_UnicodeCodePoint::ON_ReplacementCharacter (U+FFFD) 
    is a popular choice for the error_code_point value.

  sNextWideChar - [out]
    If sNextWideChar is not null, then *sNextWideChar points to the first
    element in the input sWideChar[] buffer that was not converted. 

    If an error occurs and is not masked, then *sNextWideChar points to
    the element of sWideChar[] where the conversion failed.  If no errors
    occur or all errors are masked, then *sNextWideChar points to
    sWideChar + sWideChar_count.

  If sUTF16_count > 0, the return value is the number of ON__UINT16
  elements written to sUTF16[].  When the return value < sUTF16_count,
  a null terminator is written to sUTF16[return value].

  If sUTF16_count == 0, the return value is the minimum number of
  ON__UINT16 elements that are needed to hold the converted string.
  The return value does not include room for a null terminator.  
  Increment the return value by one if you want to have an element
  to use for a null terminator.

      first element is ignored and decoding begins with the second
      element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is bytes swapped UTF-32 BOM (0xFFFE0000),
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the 
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - In all other cases the first element of the input buffer is
      decoded and no byte swapping is performed.

  sUTF16 - [in]
    UTF-16 string to convert.

  sUTF16_count - [in]
    If sUTF16_count >= 0, then it specifies the number of
    ON__UINT16 elements in sUTF16[] to convert.

    If sUTF16_count == -1, then sUTF16 must be a null terminated
    string and all the elements up to the first null element are
    converted.

  sWideChar - [out]
    If sWideChar is not null and sWideChar_count > 0, then the
    output string is returned in this buffer. If there is room
    for the null terminator, the converted string will be null
    terminated. The null terminator is never included in the count 
    of returned by this function. The converted string is in the 
    CPU's native byte order. No byte order mark is prepended.

  sWideChar_count - [in]
    If sWideChar_count > 0, then it specifies the number of available
    wchar_t elements in the sWideChar[] buffer.
    
    If sWideChar_count == 0, then the sWideChar parameter is ignored.

  error_status - [out]
    If error_status is not null, then bits of *error_status are
    set to indicate the success or failure of the conversion.  
    When the error_mask parameter is used to used to mask some
    conversion errors, multiple bits may be set.
       0: Successful conversion with no errors.
       1: The input parameters were invalid. 
          This error cannot be masked.
       2: The output buffer was not large enough to hold the converted
          string. As much conversion as possible is performed in this
          case and the error cannot be masked.
       4: When parsing a UTF-8 or UTF-32 string, the values of two
          consecutive encoding sequences formed a valid UTF-16 
          surrogate pair.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (4 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the surrogate pair is
          decoded, the value of the resulting unicode code point
          is used, and parsing continues.
       8: An overlong UTF-8 encoding sequence was encountered and 
          the value of the overlong sUTF-8 equence was a valid
          unicode code point.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (8 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the unicode code point
          is used and parsing continues.
      16: An illegal UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoding sequence occurred
          or an invalid unicode code point value resulted from decoding
          a UTF-8 sequence. 
          This error is masked if 0 != (16 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked and the value of error_code_point is
          a valid unicode code point, then error_code_point is encoded
          in the output string and parsing continues.

  error_mask - [in]
    If 0 != (error_mask & 4), then type 4 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 8), then type 8 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 16) and error_code_point is a valid unicode
    code point value, then type 16 errors are masked.

  error_code_point - [in]
    Unicode code point value to use in when masking type 16 errors.
    If 0 == (error_mask & 16), then this parameter is ignored.
    ON_UnicodeCodePoint::ON_ReplacementCharacter (U+FFFD) 
    is a popular choice for the error_code_point value.

  sNextUTF16 - [out]
    If sNextUTF16 is not null, then *sNextUTF16 points to the first
    element in the input sUTF16[] buffer that was not converted. 

    If an error occurs and is not masked, then *sNextUTF8 points to
    the element of sUTF16[] where the conversion failed.  If no errors
    occur or all errors are masked, then *sNextUTF16 points to
    sUTF16 + sUTF16_count.

Returns:
  If sWideChar_count > 0, the return value is the number of wchar_t
  elements written to sWideChar[].  When the return value < sWideChar_count,
  a null terminator is written to sWideChar[return value].

  If sWideChar_count == 0, the return value is the minimum number of
  wchar_t elements that are needed to hold the converted string.
  The return value does not include room for a null terminator.  
  Increment the return value by one if you want to have an element
  to use for a null terminator.

Description:
  Convert a UTF-32 encoded string to wchar_t string using
  the native platform's most common encoding.

  If 1 = sizeof(wchar_t), then UTF-8 encoding is used for the
  output string.

  If 2 = sizeof(wchar_t), then UTF-16 encoding is used for the
  output string. This is the case with current versions of
  Microsoft Windows.

  If 4 = sizeof(wchar_t), then UTF-32 encoding is used for the
  output string. This is the case with current versions of
  Apple OSX.

Parameters:
  bTestByteOrder - [in]
    If bTestByteOrder is true and the the input buffer is a 
    byte order mark (BOM), then the BOM is skipped.  It the value
    of the BOM is byte swapped, then subsequent input elements are
    byte swapped before being decoded. Specifically:
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 1 byte and the
      values of the first three input elements are a UTF-8 BOM 
      (0xEF, 0xBB, 0xBF), then the first three input elements are
      ignored and decoding begins at the forth input element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-16 BOM (0xFEFF), then the first
      element is ignored and decoding begins with the second element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 2 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a byte swapped UTF-16 BOM (0xFFFE), 
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is a UTF-32 BOM (0x0000FEFF), then the 
      first element is ignored and decoding begins with the second
      element.
    - If the size of an input buffer element is 4 bytes and the value
      of the first element is bytes swapped UTF-32 BOM (0xFFFE0000),
      then the first element is ignored, decoding begins with the 
      second element, and input element bytes are swapped before 
      being decoded.
    - In all other cases the first element of the input buffer is
      decoded and no byte swapping is performed.

  sUTF32 - [in]
    UTF-32 string to convert.

  sUTF32_count - [in]
    If sUTF32_count >= 0, then it specifies the number of
    ON__UINT32 elements in sUTF32[] to convert.

    If sUTF32_count == -1, then sUTF32 must be a null terminated
    string and all the elements up to the first null element are
    converted.

  sWideChar - [out]
    If sWideChar is not null and sWideChar_count > 0, then the
    output string is returned in this buffer. If there is room
    for the null terminator, the converted string will be null
    terminated. The null terminator is never included in the count 
    of returned by this function. The converted string is in the 
    CPU's native byte order. No byte order mark is prepended.

  sWideChar_count - [in]
    If sWideChar_count > 0, then it specifies the number of available
    wchar_t elements in the sWideChar[] buffer.
    
    If sWideChar_count == 0, then the sWideChar parameter is ignored.

  error_status - [out]
    If error_status is not null, then bits of *error_status are
    set to indicate the success or failure of the conversion.  
    When the error_mask parameter is used to used to mask some
    conversion errors, multiple bits may be set.
       0: Successful conversion with no errors.
       1: The input parameters were invalid. 
          This error cannot be masked.
       2: The output buffer was not large enough to hold the converted
          string. As much conversion as possible is performed in this
          case and the error cannot be masked.
       4: When parsing a UTF-8 or UTF-32 string, the values of two
          consecutive encoding sequences formed a valid UTF-16 
          surrogate pair.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (4 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the surrogate pair is
          decoded, the value of the resulting unicode code point
          is used, and parsing continues.
       8: An overlong UTF-8 encoding sequence was encountered and 
          the value of the overlong sUTF-8 equence was a valid
          unicode code point.           
          This error is masked if 0 != (8 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked, then the unicode code point
          is used and parsing continues.
      16: An illegal UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32 encoding sequence occurred
          or an invalid unicode code point value resulted from decoding
          a UTF-8 sequence. 
          This error is masked if 0 != (16 & m_error_mask).
          If the error is masked and the value of error_code_point is
          a valid unicode code point, then error_code_point is encoded
          in the output string and parsing continues.

  error_mask - [in]
    If 0 != (error_mask & 4), then type 4 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 8), then type 8 errors are masked.
    If 0 != (error_mask & 16) and error_code_point is a valid unicode
    code point value, then type 16 errors are masked.

  error_code_point - [in]
    Unicode code point value to use in when masking type 16 errors.
    If 0 == (error_mask & 16), then this parameter is ignored.
    ON_UnicodeCodePoint::ON_ReplacementCharacter (U+FFFD) 
    is a popular choice for the error_code_point value.

  sNextUTF32 - [out]
    If sNextUTF32 is not null, then *sNextUTF32 points to the first
    element in the input sUTF32[] buffer that was not converted. 

    If an error occurs and is not masked, then *sNextUTF8 points to
    the element of sUTF32[] where the conversion failed.  If no errors
    occur or all errors are masked, then *sNextUTF32 points to
    sUTF32 + sUTF32_count.

Returns:
  If sWideChar_count > 0, the return value is the number of wchar_t
  elements written to sWideChar[].  When the return value < sWideChar_count,
  a null terminator is written to sWideChar[return value].

  If sWideChar_count == 0, the return value is the minimum number of
  wchar_t elements that are needed to hold the converted string.
  The return value does not include room for a null terminator.  
  Increment the return value by one if you want to have an element
  to use for a null terminator.
