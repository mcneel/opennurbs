Description:
  ON_SerialNumberMap provides a way to map set of unique 
  serial number - uuid pairs to application defined values
  so that adding, finding and removing serial numbers is 
  fast and efficient.  The class is designed to handle
  several millions of unique serial numbers.  There are no
  restrictions on what order numbers are added and removed.
  The minimum memory footprint is less than 150KB and doesn't
  increase until you have more than 8000 serial numbers.
  It is possible to have an active serial number and an
  inactive id.
