  Description:
    Create a fixed size memory pool.
    If you have a decent estimate of how many elements you need, 
    CreateForExperts() is a typically a better choice. 
    Otherwise, Create(sizeof_element) is typically the best option.

  Parameters:
    sizeof_element - [in]
      number of bytes in each element. This parameter must be greater than zero.
      In general, use sizeof(element type).  If you pass a "raw" number as
      sizeof_element, then be certain that it is the right size to insure the
      fields in your elements will be properly aligned.
    element_count_estimate - [in] (0 = good default)
      If you know how many elements you will need, pass that number here.
      It is better to slightly overestimate than to slightly underestimate.
      If you do not have a good estimate, then use zero.
    block_element_capacity - [in] (0 = good default)
      If block_element_capacity is zero, Create() will calculate a block
      size that is efficient for most applications.  If you are an expert
      user and want to specify the number of elements per block,
      then pass the number of elements per block here.  When
      block_element_capacity > 0 and element_count_estimate > 0, the first
      block will have a capacity of at least element_count_estimate; in this
      case do not ask for extraordinarly large amounts of contiguous heap.

    You must call Create() on an unused ON_FixedSizePool or call Destroy()
    before calling create.
  Returns:
    True if successful and the pool can be used.

    maximum_element_count_estimate - [in] (0 = good default)
      If you have a tight upper bound on the number of elements you need

      If the description of this parameter is confusing to you,
      call Create(sizeof_element) instead.

      If you have a tight upper bound on how many elements you will need,

    minimum_block2_element_capacity - [in] (0 = good default)
      If the description below is confusing, pass 0.
      If maximum_element_count_estimate = 0, this parameter is ignored.
      If maximum_element_count_estimate > 0 and you have an excellent choice 
      for a lower bound on the number of elements per block for unexpected allocations
      of more than maximum_element_count_estimate elements, then pass that value for

      you return a pointer no more than one time.
  Remarks:
    If multiple threads are using this pool, then use ThreadSafeReturnElement().

    If you find the following remarks confusing, but you really want to use
    ReturnElement(), then here are some simple guidelines.
      1) SizeofElement() must be >= 16
      2) SizeofElement() must be a multiple of 8.
      3) Do not use FirstElement() and NextElement() to iterate through
         the pool.

    If 1 to 3 don't work for you, then you need to understand the following
    information before using ReturnElement().

    ON_FixedMemoryPool uses the first sizeof(void*) bytes of the
    returned element for bookkeeping purposes.  Therefore, if you
    are going to use ReturnElement(), then SizeofElement() must be 
    at least sizeof(void*).  If you are using a platform that requires
    pointers to be aligned on sizeof(void*) boundaries, then
    SizeofElement() must be a multiple of sizeof(void*).
    If you are going to use ReturnElement() and then use FirstElement()
    and NextElement() to iterate through the list of elements, then you
    need to set a value in the returned element to indicate that it
    needs to be skipped during the iteration.  This value cannot be
    located in the fist sizeof(void*) bytes of the element.  If the 
    element is a class with a vtable, you cannot call a virtual 
    function on a returned element because the vtable pointer is 
    trashed when ReturnElement() modifies the fist sizeof(void*) bytes.

  Remarks:
    It is faster to use FirstElement() and NextElement() to iterate
    through the entire list of elements.  This function is relatively
    efficient when there are a few large blocks in the pool
    or element_index is small compared to the number of elements
    in the first few blocks.

    If ReturnElement() is not used or AllocateElement() calls to
    are made after any use of ReturnElement(), then the i-th 
    element is the one returned by the (i+1)-th call to 
    AllocateElement().

  /*
  Description:
    Get the first element when iterating through the list of elements.
  Parameters:
    element_index - [in]
      If you use the version of FirstElement() that has an 
      element_index parameter, then the iteration begins at
      that element.
  Example:
    The loop will iteratate through all the elements returned from
    AllocateElement(), including any that have be returned to the pool
    using ReturnElement().

          // iterate through all elements in the pool
          // This iteration will go through TotalElements() items.
          for ( void* p = FirstElement(); 0 != p; p = NextElement() )
          {
            // If you are not using ReturnElement(), then you may process
            // "p" immediately. If you have used ReturnElement(), then you
            // must check some value in p located after the first sizeof(void*)
            // bytes to see if p is active.
            if ( p is not active )
              continue;

            ... process p
          }

  Returns:
    The first element when iterating through the list of elements.
  Remarks:
    FirstElement() and NextElement() will return elements that have 
    been returned to the pool using ReturnElement().  If you use 
    ReturnElement(), then be sure to mark the element so it can be
    identified and skipped.

  Parameters:
