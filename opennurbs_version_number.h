Description:
  Create a 4-byte unsigned integer value that has desirable version 
  number properties.

Parameters:
  major_version - [in]
    major_version >= 0 and major_version <= 63

  minor_version - [in]
    minor_version >= 0 and minor_version <= 127

  year - [in]
    year >= 2000 and year <= 2099

  month - [in]
    month >= 1 and month <= 12

  day_of_month - [in]
    day_of_month >= 1 and day_of_month <= ON_DaysInMonthOfGregorianYear(year,month)

  platform_branch - [in]
    0: developer build
    1: Windows Commercial build
    2: Mac Commercial build
    3: Windows BETA build
    4: Mac Beta build
    5: Windows WIP build
    6: Mac WIP build

Returns:
  If the input values are valid, this returns
  a 4-byte nonzero version number with the following properties:
  verA = ON_VersionNumberConstruct(majorA,minorA,<timeA>,branchA)
  verB = ON_VersionNumberConstruct(majorB,minorB,<timeB>,branchB)
  - If majorA > majorB, then verA > verB.
  - If majorA = majorB and minorA > minorB, then verA > verB.
  - If majorA = majorB and minorA = minorB and 
    timeA > timeB, then verA > verB.
  - If majorA = majorB, minorA = minorB, timeA = timeB, and
    branchA > branchB, then verA > verB.
  If any input is not valid, then zero is returned.
